# OnlineTollPlazaSystem
This is a web development project made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL. PhpMyAdmin is used as the open-source administrative tool for SQL.

### Idea:

Along with the growing number of vehicles in major cities, and an online toll plaza is an option for smooth transportation. 

Manual toll plazas are widely used for toll fee collection in India but the manual system requires a lot of paperwork and is also prone to errors, also increasing the processing time. Also, during festive seasons this system may cause congestion leading to fuel wastage and causing pollution.

To overcome these issues, I have introduced an online system to pay the toll fee. This will help to reduce the traffic at the toll plaza and will also help to save fuel resources and reduce pollution which is a major topic of concern these days.

The Toll system is available for use by both the administration and the user. The administrator and users will use the webpage as a front end. The browser goes through the HTTP server. 

Application server manages the connection between the front end and backend, all types of information and data, that are necessary for the users are stored in the database server.
